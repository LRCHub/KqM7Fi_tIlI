[00:00.99] Haze you.
[00:05.49] 
[00:18.05] She's dressed up in diamond dust
[00:20.57] A lover of decay
[00:23.72] Coated lashes, soul of ashes
[00:26.48] What more can I say?
[00:29.17] 踏みつけたアリの行列なんて
[00:34.20] 気付いてないと誰もが思う
[00:40.21] Loving you, killing you, isn't it thrilling? You've
[00:42.00] Said enough from those guts you've been spilling through
[00:43.32] Crying and begging, a lovely sound
[00:44.70] I tear at your soul, but ya still stick around.
[00:45.97] What I've found is a treasure indeed,
[00:47.52] A friend who can bend to my every need
[00:48.83] I'll use and abuse you and never feel bad
[00:50.15] Until suddenly, funnily, you take my hand
[00:51.50] Tangle you tight in the yarns that I've spun and I'll
[00:53.11] Do it again, to get what I want
[00:54.14] Pretend that I'm harmless, I'm actually alarmed this is
[00:55.70] Something charming to anyone... (wow)
[00:56.84] The fact can actually make Death wanna Die?
[00:58.63] I'm the one that you love, and I'm making you cry
[00:59.98] And it's "just me", after all.
[01:14.98] 
[01:05.01] I'll give you fire.
[01:06.64] 心に飼う
[01:09.82] Hello? 餓狼 餓狼
[01:12.13] 唸り駆ける
[01:17.21] また意地悪な爪を立てて狩ってあげる
[01:28.45] Haze you.
[01:32.95] 
[01:31.08] When the curtains finally close and the show's really over
[01:33.90] If you glance into my past, it's just nothing new
[01:36.89] Lying, conniving, thriving on hate
[01:39.79] I'll tell you it was "all for you."
[01:42.85] お聞きなさい
[01:43.94] ホントの薔薇は自分の刺に
[01:47.70] 傷ついたりしないものよ
[01:53.45] Ya know,
[01:53.92] I want you to care that I want you to stay
[01:55.10] So I swear I won't blame you if you turn away
[01:56.55] At the end of the day, I will smile and give in
[01:58.13] To this burning and vile original sin
[01:59.43] Cuz hell is the realization your selfish
[02:01.04] And drawn to the loving, the soft and the helpless
[02:02.18] I can see through that facade that you wear
[02:03.55] When your honest, and promise you'll fight the despair
[02:05.08] And I'll say it again, that I know I'm the worst
[02:06.34] So then how can you spend so much love on the person that hurts you
[02:08.25] Like I do?
[02:09.30] Cuz inside, I can't hide that I cannot desert you
[02:10.89] And if I'm "the world" to you, surely you
[02:12.76] Never stood even a chance at all, didn't you?
[02:13.75] It's me, after all.
[02:23.25] 
[02:20.61] I'll give you fire.
[02:22.84] 心に飼う
[02:25.97] Hello? 餓狼 餓狼
[02:28.66] 唸り駆ける
[02:33.35] また意地悪な爪を立てて狩ってあげる
[02:41.85] 
[02:44.71] 来訪 宵の羽音
[02:49.96] 熟れ残果啄ばむ鴉かな
[02:55.71] Don't be afraid.
[03:00.59] いい子ね もうお眠り
[03:05.59] 
[03:08.87] I'll give you fire.
[03:10.59] Just keep it to yourself.
[03:13.98] Hello, the hungry wolf
[03:16.73] Has come to give you hell
[03:21.23] Once again I'll treat you nice,
[03:25.47] Think twice before you fall
[03:28.17] And smile while you do.
[03:39.67] 
[03:31.05] Love, the me that's killing you.
[03:47.05] 
[03:39.66] 餓狼 餓狼 餓狼
[03:43.66] 
[03:50.62] 餓狼 餓狼 餓狼
[03:54.62] 
[03:58.27] Haze you...
